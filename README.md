## 🧠 Why We Built This

We created WP Site Inspector because:

- WordPress sites grow messy — fast  
- Devs spend hours asking “What’s active and why?”  
- Legacy code makes debugging painful  

This plugin saves time, simplifies audits, and ensures smoother handoffs.  
No fluff. No guesswork. Just answers.
