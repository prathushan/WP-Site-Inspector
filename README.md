## 🧠 Why We Built This

We created WP Site Inspector because:

- WordPress sites get messy — especially over time  
- Developers waste hours just figuring out "what’s active and why"  
- Legacy code and untracked changes make debugging a nightmare  

This plugin exists to **save you time**, simplify audits, and make handoffs smoother.  
No fluff. No guesswork. Just answers.
