 🔍 WordPress WP Site Inspector Plugin

Instantly map shortcodes, hooks, APIs, and more in any WordPress theme — a developer’s time-saving debug assistant.

 🧠 What This Plugin Does

The **WordPress Site Inspector** is a must-have utility for WordPress developers, freelancers, and agencies working with custom or legacy themes. It helps you instantly scan the active theme (and parent theme) to uncover:

- ✅ Shortcodes (`add_shortcode`, `do_shortcode`)
- ✅ Action and filter hooks (`add_action`, `apply_filters`)
- ✅ External APIs and CDN references
- ✅ JavaScript and CSS file usage
- ✅ Custom post types
- ✅ Templates being used
- ✅ Plugins referenced via theme code
- ✅ Published pages and posts

Instead of manually searching through theme files, this tool shows you what’s used and where — with file paths and line numbers.
