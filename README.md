🧠 Why We Built This
We created WP Site Inspector because:
WordPress sites get messy — especially over time.
Developers waste hours just figuring out "what’s active and why."
Legacy code, third-party themes, and untracked changes make debugging a nightmare.


This plugin exists to save you time, simplify audits, and make handoffs smoother.
No fluff. No guesswork. Just answers.
